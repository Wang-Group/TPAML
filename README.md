We think Comprehensive_Molecular_Featurizer_V2.0 is possibly helpful, because it can generate feature matrix based on Molecular fragment fingerprint(MFF), RDkit, and MFF-MOE.

The data of two-photon absorption  of this study are openly available in figshare at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6264228.v2, reference number 6264228.  Predictions of ML-TPA cross section can be done with open source, free package MLatom at http://mlatom.com. In addition, calculations can be performed online using the MLatom@XACS (Xiamen Atomistic Computing Suite) cloud computing service at http://XACScloud.com
